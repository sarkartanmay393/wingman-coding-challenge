// NOTE for Dibyendu

// please do pixel-perfect
// including good architecture of UI

// here only dashboard are is scrollable
// use exact same text-size, image-size, padding, margin, border-radius and everything else.
// the whole UI must be interactive, interactive doesn't mean fancy animations. Just maybe hovering on a number scales it up by 0.2
// Insight are must be highly interactive

// Please have dummy data on table and use any table library you want. But I have already installed most of the necessary things.
// One important point is Sorting on Table columns. Table library should contain a field to apply sorting on that table. Implement that.
// Order table is scrollable both direction (x and y). X scroll maybe needed for mobile screens.

// At a glance section:
// Can show the percentage and numbers on the card rolling from 0 to that on first render.
// Upon changing the day selector (7days, 30days), it should update the dummy data (optional).

// Most Important:
// 1. Pixel Perfect
// 2. Use tailwind constants (e.g. text-sm, text-xl, bg-red-300) - I will tell more on call about this
// 3. Code structure (Not rewriting same code, if one component is being used in 3 places then we should have a reusable component for that)
// 4. UI must be fast, no gitter while scrolling ðŸš€

// Sidebar has three items. No functiontionality needed, but it should have a hover effect or something.
// Final UI expectations: Production-ready UI without all the functionalites.
